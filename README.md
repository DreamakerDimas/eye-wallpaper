# signalis-eye-wallpaper
I love signalis

I ripped the assets from the game but couldn't use the 3D models as I would have to use three.js. That's a possibility maybe in the future. <br />
So this very basic wallpaper is done with just tracking mouse movement. Works with lively wallpaper. 
## Steps to use wallpaper
1. Download lively wallpaper if you havent (Don't know if this works with wallpaper engine)
2. Unzip latest release from the release page
3. For lively wallpaper: Click add wallpaper and select "index.html"
4. Enjoy?
