# signalis-eye-wallpaper
I love signalis

I ripped the assets from the game but couldn't use the 3D models as I would have to use three.js. That's a possibility maybe in the future. <br />
So this very basic wallpaper is done with just tracking mouse movement. Works with lively wallpaper. Just clone the repository and add the html file to custom wallpapers and it should work.
